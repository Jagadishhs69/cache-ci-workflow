1. **Artifacts:** After the "build" step, create a dummy build output (e.g., a `dist/` folder with a single file inside it). Upload this build output as a workflow artifact.    2. **Caching:** Implement caching for your project's dependencies (e.g., `node_modules` for Node.js, `pip` cache for Python) to speed up subsequent workflow runs.
